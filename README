# PlaneNote

PlaneNote is a full-stack application built with Laravel, React, Tailwind CSS, and Vite. It supports separate login systems for staff and customers.

## Features

- **Staff Authentication:** Uses the `users` table.
- **Customer Authentication:** Uses separate customer login credentials.
- **React UI:** Developed with React and styled using Tailwind CSS.
- **Modern Build Tool:** Powered by Vite for fast development.

## Requirements

- PHP 8.0+
- Composer
- Node.js & npm

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd PlaneNote
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

#### PHP Dependencies
```bash
composer install
```

#### Node Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment

Copy the example environment file and generate an app key:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
```

Ensure your `.env` file has the correct database settings. By default, this project uses SQLite.

### 4. Run Migrations

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

### 5. Run Development Servers

#### Laravel Backend
```bash
php artisan serve
```
This will serve the backend on [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

#### React Frontend via Vite
```bash
npm run dev
```
This runs the Vite development server, serving the React app on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

## Routing

- **Staff Login:** [http://localhost:8000/staff/login](http://localhost:8000/staff/login)
- **Customer Login:** [http://localhost:8000/customer/login](http://localhost:8000/customer/login)
  (The `/customer/login` route loads the React page.)

## Project Structure

- **Laravel Backend:** Located in the root and `routes/`, `app/` directories.
- **React Frontend:** Main entry is located at `resources/js/index.tsx` with pages under `resources/js/Pages/`.
- **Styles:** Global styles in `resources/css/app.css`.
- **Blade Shell:** SPA shell at `resources/views/app.blade.php`.

## Customization

- Adjust React components in `resources/js/Pages/` as needed.
- Update backend logic and routing in Laravel (`routes/web.php`, `routes/auth.php`).
- Modify Tailwind CSS or add additional styling in `resources/css/app.css`.

## Troubleshooting

- **Undefined Variable Issues:** Ensure any Inertia or unused directives are removed from Blade layout.
- **UI Problems:** Verify that the Vite development server is running and routing is configured properly.
- If changes arenâ€™t reflecting, clear cache:
  ```bash
  php artisan config:clear
  php artisan view:clear
  ```
- Verify that the SPA shell in `app.blade.php` only contains:
  ```html
  <div id="app"></div>
  @viteReactRefresh
  @vite('resources/js/index.tsx')
  ```
